"Queima das Barraquinhas" is an academic project, developed in the multimedia course of the Faculty of Engineering,
University of Porto.

It is a two-player shooter, inspired by our famous student's party, taking place in the end of each academic year.

Each player has two kinds of projectiles:

- rock, with which he can destroy the opposite barrack;
- bottle, with which he can hit the opposing character, making more difficult to him to focus a shoot. The player gets 
  "drunk" but can restore is accuracy by clicking on the ambulance near hime. This projectile only becomes available 
  when the player hits the opposing team's powerups, represented by bottles inside the barrack.

The final objective is to hit and destroy the bigger bottle in the opposing barrack.
